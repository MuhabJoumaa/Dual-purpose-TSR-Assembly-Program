# Dual-purpose-TSR-Assembly-Program
A dual-purpose TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program that provides two modes: a pop-up dictionary translator activated by pressing Shift, which searches and translates words from a file-based dictionary, and a file input mode that allows users to enter words interactively and append them to a text file.
